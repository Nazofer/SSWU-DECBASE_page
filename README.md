# SSWU-DECBASE_page

Welcome to the DECBASE company landing page! 

This page is a homework assignment for the Sigma Software JavaScript Camp.
## Technologies
This landing page has been designed using SASS(SCSS) with BEM methodology, HTML, and JavaScript.

## Dependencies
This landing page relies on the following libraries:

+ **[Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/) - Used to create the carousel**
+ **[Confetti.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/confetti-js) - Used to create the confetti animation**

## Features
### **[SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/doccumentation#filmsData) data fetching**
The page utilizes the **Star Wars API** to render cards and displays them in a Service section on the page.

Fetched different categories like people, starships, planets, species, etc. Then, rendered the cards with some attributes as a card description and set the filter to distinguish every category.

The 'All' filter displays the first project of each type with a total of three projects shown.
### JS features
The sticky navigation bar, which contains links and progress on the page, provides smooth scrolling to every section.

Smooth appearance of some sections on the page using Intersection Observer.

**Swiper.js** used to make a multifunctional carousel, reacting to swipes, not only buttons pressing, and working pagination.

Form validation using RegExp, invoking greeting modal window in successful authorize case.

Additionally, **Confetti.js** has been used to create a fun animation for successfully authorized users.

Other small features like getting Date and alerting to make sure that the user is active.
